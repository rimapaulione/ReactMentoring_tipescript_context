# React TypeScript project

<p>This application is a simple project aimed at better understanding TypeScript and integrating it with context and useReducer. The app includes reusable button, input, and modal components integrated with TypeScript.

In this app, you can add booked courses, check upcoming sessions end delete them.

For the development of this application, I chose to use context and useReducer.
